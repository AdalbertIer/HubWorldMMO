After setting up [OWS 2](https://openworldserver.com/), and getting your API Key, run the Initialize.sql script on the OpenWorldServer database.  Be sure to put your API Key in the first line of Initialize.sql before running it.

The rest of the setup steps match the setup steps for the OWS Starter Project.  Modify OWSInstanceLauncher/appsettings.json and DefaultGame.ini with your API key.
